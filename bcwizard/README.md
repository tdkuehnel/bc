bcwizard is an application wizard for MS VFP 6.0. It belongs to the bc project, a basar in the cathedral. See the readme.md ot the bc project for more info.

As VFP stores some absolute paths in its project files, when you first open the project you will be asked if you want the directory where you downloaded and installed/extracted the bcwizard project files to be the new default home dir of the project. That generally should be ok. Alternativerly, the absolute path used for developing this project is "T:\bc\bcwizard", if you can use this, no question will be asked.

Activation: Set the _WIZARD system variable of your VFP installation pointing to the bcwizard.app file, and call the application wizard from the menu.
